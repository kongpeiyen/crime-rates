#Abstract for home page on website 

Our project aimed to explore the relationship between crime and covid-19 in London. Covid-19 is a new occurence, and no previous study has done research on crime and Covid-19, specifically in the context of London.
We focused on three crimes for our project - burglary, sexual offences and drug offences. This was narrowed down after extensive literature review. 
For each crime, we came up with our hypotheses as follows: 
  Hypothesis 1: we hypothesize that the number of residential burglaries decreased after the outbreak of covid19
  Hypothesis 2:  we hypothesize that the number of commercial burglaries increased after the outbreak of covid19
  Hypothesis 3: we hypothesize that the number of sexual assaults changed after the outbreak of covid19
  Hypothesis 4: we hypothesize that the number of drug offenses changed after the outbreak of covid19 
  
To conduct our research, we first cleaned our data. We presented this cleaned data in the form of (what we choose) in order to show (aim).
We then did a predictive model to compare how crime rates would have been if covid-19 had not occured, and compared it to the actual 2020 crime rate.
We then built on this predictive model with our interactive chloropleth map, which was designed to view how 

After our extensive data visualisations, we were able to analyse our data we had collected. The results we obtained were as follows.
(state results for each) 

This hence leads to (state which) hypotheses being accepted/ rejected.

We do acknowledge that there are limitations to our project - such as (state).

However, we have ensured that our process is as reproducible as possible. We have included our steps taken for each section, and have stated where we obtained our data from. We are more than happy for others to build on our findings regarding this area.  





#updated abstract
Our project aimed to explore the relationship between crime and covid-19 in London. 
Covid-19 is a new occurrence and to our knowledge there is no previous academic literature on crime and Covid-19, specifically in the context of London.

We focused on three crimes for our project - burglary, sexual offences and drug offences. 
This was narrowed down after extensive literature review. 



For each crime, we came up with our hypotheses as follows based on our literature review: 
Burglaries 
Null Hypothesis 1:  we hypothesize that the number of commercial burglaries did not change after the outbreak of Covid-19
Alternative Hypothesis 1: we hypothesize that the number of commercial burglaries increased after the outbreak of Covid-19

Null Hypothesis 2: we hypothesize that the number of residential burglaries did not change after the outbreak of Covid-19
Alternative Hypothesis 2: we hypothesize that the number of residential burglaries decreased after the outbreak of Covid-19


Sexual assaults 
Null Hypothesis 3: we hypothesize that the number of sexual offences did not change after the outbreak of Covid-19
Alternative Hypothesis 3:  we hypothesize that the number of sexual offences increased after the outbreak of Covid-19 

Null Hypothesis 4: we hypothesize that rapes did not change after the outbreak of Covid-19
Alternative Hypothesis 4: we hypothesize that rapes decreased after the outbreak of Covid-19


Drug offences 
Null Hypothesis 5: we hypothesize that the possession of drugs did not change after the outbreak of Covid-19
Alternative Hypothesis 5: we hypothesize that the possession of drugs increased after the outbreak of Covid-19

 Null Hypothesis 6: we hypothesize that the number of drug trafficking did not change after the outbreak of Covid-19
Alternative Hypothesis 6: we hypothesize that the number of drug trafficking increased after the outbreak of Covid-19




To conduct our research, we first cleaned our data. We used this cleaned data for our predictive model. 
We constructed a predictive model to compare crime rates in the hypothetical scenario in which there had not been an outbreak of coronavirus and government enforced lockdowns in 2020 to the actual crime numbers for 2020. 

Our group also created an interactive chloropleth map to further analyse the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus on crime in specific boroughs from a geospatial angle. This was designed to analyse further the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus on crime in specific boroughs from a geospatial angle. 
We believed that the map would allow a more thorough analysis on the influence of coronavirus on crime rates. 




After making our data visualisations and predictive model, we were able to analyse our data we had collected. The results we obtained were as follows:

Burglaries 

1a: Commercial burglaries decreased after the outbreak of Covid-19. 
As the team had hypothesized an increase for all months of 2020, at an alpha level of 0.05 we cannot reject the null-hypothesis 1 in favour of the alternative hypothesis 1. 

1b: Residential burglaries decreased after the outbreak of Covid-19. 
However, because not all values fall outside the prediction interval for all months of 2020, at an alpha level of 0.05, we cannot reject the null-hypothesis 2 in favour of the alternative hypothesis 2.



Sexual assaults 

2a. Sexual offences increased after the outbreak of Covid-19. 
Therefore, because the team expected that sexual offences (other than rape) would decrease during COVID-19 for all months of 2020, at an alpha level of 0.05, we cannot reject the null-hypothesis 3 in favour of the alternative hypothesis. 3

2b. Rapes decreased after the outbreak of Covid-19. 
Therefore, because the team expected a decrease for all months of 2020, at an alpha level of 0.05, we can reject the null-hypothesis 4 in favour of the alternative hypothesis 4.
 

Drug offences 

3a. It is difficu
lt to tell whether the number of possession of drugs has increased or decreased because of the pandemic as the real trend is higher than the predicted one for some months and it is lower for others. 
Therefore, at an alpha level of 0.05, we cannot reject the null-hypothesis 5 in favour of the alternative hypothesis 5. 

3b.  Drug trafficking increased after the outbreak of Covid-19. 
Therefore, because the team expected an increase for all months of 2020, at an alpha level of 0.05, we are able to reject the null-hypothesis 6 in favour of the alternative hypothesis 6. 



We do acknowledge that there are limitations to our project. 
Firstly,  predictive methods are not totally accurate and the values we have predicted are not the only possible ones. 
We have provided a test of the accuracy of our model in hopes of acknowledging the limitations as regards to accuracy for future readers. 

There are also limitations to the chloropleth map, such as the different intervals used on the legend due to our normalized data between each category is of different order. 

We are also limited by our dataset because we are using the same source for all our crime rates data. 
This limitation can be attributed to the highly sensitive nature of crime meaning that we can only use crime rates from government databases. 

Moreover, because of the available data and the ongoing nature of the pandemic, we are limited to a certain timeframe: 2008-2020. 
We encourage future researchers to look at crime rates over a longer period to increase the accuracy of their predicted crime trends. 

Furthermore, the ongoing nature of the pandemic also limits our conclusions as we are unable to look at the situation with hindsight. 

Although there are limitations, we have ensured that our process is as reproducible as possible so that others who may have more data can replicate our research. 
We have included our steps taken for each section, and have stated where we obtained our data from. We have also included gists and a link to our GitHub Repository with our full code. We are more than happy for others to build on our findings regarding this area.

Our project aimed to explore the relationship between crime and Covid-19 in London. 

We focused on three crimes for our project - burglary, sexual offences and drug offences. 



To conduct our research, we first cleaned our data. 

This enabled us to create bar charts to visualisation the evolution of the three categories of crimes we were investigating.
 
 
 
 
Our group also created an interactive choropleth map to further analyse the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus on crime in specific boroughs from a geospatial angle.



We also created a predictive model ARIMA on Python. 

This was used to compare crime rates in the hypothetical scenario in which there had not been an outbreak of coronavirus and government-enforced lockdowns in 2020 with the actual crime numbers for 2020. 



In conclusion, rapes and commercial burglaries are the only types of crime for which we have found statistically significant results.

We were able to draw this conclusion because the actual crime rates for 2020 are outside the prediction interval for 2020, which considers what the crime rates would have been in the absence of the pandemic.






# final abstract


Our project aims to quantitatively explore the relationship between crime and Covid-19 in London. 

We focused on three crimes for our project - burglary, sexual offences and drug offences. 

To conduct our research, we first cleaned our data. 

This enabled us to create bar charts to visualise the evolution of the three categories of crimes we were investigating.



Our group also created an interactive choropleth map to further analyse the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus on crime in specific boroughs from a geospatial angle. 

However, we found no correlation between the COVID-19 cases and the number of burglaries, sexual offences or drug offences committed across the different London boroughs between 2008 and 2020.


Finally, we constructed  a predictive model using the auto-ARIMA Python package. 

This was used to compare crime rates in the hypothetical scenario in which there had not been an outbreak of coronavirus and government-enforced lockdowns in 2020 with the actual crime numbers for 2020. 

Our research showed that rape and commercial burglaries are the only types of crime for which we have found statistically significant results. 

Studying the full impact of the pandemic on society is crucial to understanding the new dynamics and challenges the world now faces and will be pivotal in policymaking in coming years. 

We hope that this project provides some small insight into the criminological effect of coronavirus on London and that future researchers will continue to study the influence of the pandemic in a crime-specific manner.
