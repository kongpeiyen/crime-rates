The international covid-19 pandemic is a period for social upheaval. It is essential to research the full impact that coronavirus and the measures enforced by governments as a result of the outbreak have on individuals and populations. Our research will contribute to the search of the impact of covid-19 in London.
While we will be careful not to generalize our research, if our data analysis suggests a correlation between covid-19 and variation of crime statistics in 2020 then our study can be a basis for further research on the matter. 
However, not all kinds of crimes saw an increase during the pandemic (Ashby, 2020). For example, previous research on burglary presents conflicting results. Therefore, it is important to conduct further studies as to clarify this discrepancy and to allow the government or the police to take actions. 



#literature review:

In 2020 the world was submerged by the outbreak of a highly contagious virus: covid-19. The international epidemic following the outbreak of the virus was and continues to be an unprecedented historic event and a period of social upheaval. Researchers have shown that social and economic changes have a major effect on crime trends (unodc.org ; Ivaschenko, et al. 2020 , Hossain, 2019 ; Ohlin, 1968 ). Therefore, our group thought it interesting to conduct research on the effect that the pandemic had on crime focusing on a specific geographical area. 

Stickle and Felson, two American criminal justice researchers have rightly called the outbreak of coronavirus the “largest criminological experiment in History” (2020) . This appellation is due to the government ordered lockdowns which completely paused and changed the routine activities of every citizen. An illustration of this is the fact that without commuters during the lockdown, the population of a certain area was unbiased which in turn improved the accuracy of crime rates relative to population size. 

In their article on crime rates during the pandemic, Stickle and Felson explain that the data collected during the pandemic can be used to test criminological theories and explain how crime has changed, the focus of our research project. The scholars suggest that the results from such projects will be crucial in later years in “influencing future crime reduction” (Stickle and Felson, 2020). 

While we will be careful to not generalize our findings, if our data analysis suggests a correlation between the outbreak of covid-19 and variation of crime statistics in 2020 then through future research our study could contribute to the understanding and eventually prevention of crime trends during the pandemic. 

Miller and Blumstein’s study on crime , justice and coronavirus has shown that the international pandemic has been a major challenge for criminal justice systems (2020). But it is also a unique opportunity to reassess the functioning of these systems, for instance incarceration policies because the everyday decisions on probation, parole, pretrial release are taken in a different context during the pandemic and the risk of infection has favoured release of prisoners in order to reduce crowded prisons (Miller and Blumstein 2020). 

“For criminologists and criminal justice scientists, the virus also presents natural experiment conditions allowing for real-world theory tests and observation of the relative effectiveness of practice and policy options under weighty condition.”

Accordingly, our study is motivated by the opportunity of providing a humble insight on crime variations so that policy makers and police forces may be able to use this information to influence future crime reduction and maybe even revaluate criminal systems (Miller and Blumstein, 2020).

Furthermore, our extensive literature review has shown that the full impact of coronavirus on crime is still not understood. This could be partly due to the fact that the pandemic is ongoing.  Nevertheless, while multiple studies examining crime rates since the outbreak of covid-19 have been published, the results of these are mixed (Stickle and Felson, 2020). Merely by reviewing the literature, our team found inconsistencies in recent studies. Stickle and Felson state that initial research has shown crime rates have fallen (2020), whereas, Ashby shows that certain crimes have increased during the pandemic (2020). These inconsistencies illustrate the need for further examination of the topic, hence, our choice of this subject for investigation.  


To contribute to existing research on coronavirus and crime rates, Stickle and Felson encourage conducting a study on “specific types of crimes, in a temporal fashion, and placed based” (2020). This suggestion motivated the framing of our research question. 


#Aims

As previously stated in the literature review, one of our central aims in conducting this research project was to contribute to existing research on the impact that the pandemic has had on crime by focusing on a specific area (London) and crime types (burglary residential and commercial, drug offences: possession and trafficking and sexual offences). 

Secondly, we wished to shed light on the understanding of crime rates during this unprecedented time for the purpose of future crime reduction and policy making within the criminal justice system. 

Lastly, we feel that understanding which crimes have increased during covid19 is essential to raising awareness and providing support for survivors and potential victims. 

Indeed, both newspapers and governmental and intergovernmental organizations have shown that lockdowns have had a negative impact on sexual crimes as more people have become victims to sexual violence. According to The Guardian, the UK’s largest domestic abuse charity, Refuge, reported that calls made to the hotline have increased by 700% since the beginning of the lockdown (12 April 2020).   . Among these cases of domestic abuse are sexual offences. 

We hope that by elucidating the effect that lockdowns have on certain people who have become victims of crime will help enlarge societal responsibility and further urge people to respect government-imposed lockdowns.


#Motivations 

Coronavirus is evidently at the forefront of news headlines. We thought it would be interesting to study a manner in which coronavirus had concretely impacted the world. We chose to look at crime rates in relation to coronavirus because our group is interested in criminology. But also, we had all read and seen sensbilization campaigns on how the lockdowns had increased the rates of domestic abuse. This led to choose to investigate the manner in which coronavirus had infleunces different types of crime in a city we all had in common, London. 

Furthermore, our motivations in choosing to investigate the relationship btween coronavirus and crime were very much inspired by our aims. 
Our group wanted to conduct a study on specific types of crime, in a particular time-frame and concentrated in an area as such research is scarce and needed (Stickle and Felson 2020). 

We were also motivated by the opportunity to research a topic with social significance and possible use. Our study could be the basis for future investigation which could potentially provide insight for police forces and policy makers and raise awareness for the potential victims of such crimes.

*Cleaning of the data for the predictive model*

In building the ARIMA predictive model and bar charts, one of the main challenges and consequential components of the code was the section on data cleaning. 

The two datasets we were working with, downloaded from the Metropolitan Police website were not in the correct format for importing into our code. To make our visualisations the most reproducible we wrote a code to ‘clean our data’. 
We had five goals in re-formatting our raw datasets: 
To get rid of the crimes our research was not focussing on:
The data sets downloaded from the Met Police website had many crimes, however, the group decided to only look at 6: ‘Burglary - Business and Community’, ‘Burglary - Residential’, ‘Drug Trafficking’, ‘Possession of Drugs’, ‘Rape’ and ‘Other Sexual Offenses’. Hence, we needed our code to get rid of all the other crimes. 
df1.drop(labels=["Arson and Criminal Damage","Miscellaneous Crimes Against Society", "Possession of Weapons", "Public Order Offences", "Robbery", "Theft", "Vehicle Offences", "Violence Against the Person"],
    axis=0,
    inplace=True
Note: this was also done for df2
 >INSERT RELEVANT CODE GIST

To get rid of the Borough column.
Our datasets were defined geographically by borough in London. The visualisations we wished to make needed the dataset to show the respective crime and time in mm/yyyy, irregardless of which borough. 
df1.drop (['LookUp_BoroughName'], axis=1, inplace=True) 
Note: this was also done for df2
>INSERT RELEVANT CODE GIST

To change the names of the crimes in one of the data sets so that the same crimes had the same name throughout the dataframe:
When combining the two data sets, the crimes would have the same name. For example, ‘Burglary- Residential’ was called ‘Burglary in Dwellings’ in one of the data sets. We changed it to ‘Burglary-Residential’ to ensure consistency of our data. 
df2.rename(index = {"Burglary in Other Buildings": "Burglary - Business and Community",  "Burglary in a Dwelling":"Burglary - Residential", "Other Sexual":"Other Sexual Offences"}, inplace = True) 
 
 >INSERT RELEVANT CODE GIST

To sum all the values for each crime for every month
Using the group.by() function so that we could plot the sums for our visualisations.
df1= df1.groupby(by='MONTH').sum()

>INSERT RELEVANT CODE GIST

To transpose our data set
So that all the variables would be in columns, rather than crime being in rows and months in columns.
df1.T.head()

>INSERT RELEVANT CODE GIST

To combine the two data set 
We have two data sets: one for the last 24 months (2018-2020), and one that starts in 2008 and ends where the first one starts and we needed to combine them into one dataframe.
df3 = pd.concat([df2, df1], axis=1, join='inner')
df3.head()
df3_final = df3.T
df3_final.head()

>INSERT RELEVANT CODE GIST

In order to use the cleaned data in the predictive model, we selected each crime according to time from the final data frame: 
rape = df3_final[["Rape"]]
rape.head()

ARIMA MODEL

-> interpreting the accuracy:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/194453/interpreting-accuracy-results-for-an-arima-model-fit

Out of all the one simplest to understand is MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error). It considers actual values fed into model and fitted values from the model and calculates absolute difference between the two as a percentage of actual value and finally calculates mean of that.
