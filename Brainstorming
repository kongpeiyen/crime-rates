# Tasks from 23 Oct 2020 
Topic: Correlation between crime rates and (factor 1) and (factor 2) in London and Singapore during xx-xx (time period) 

To do: 
  Figure out timeframe to use 
  Figure out the factors
  Figure out if the cities work 

things to think about: 
-the rationale: why these cities? why these variables? why this timeframe? -> rationale should bebased on literature review or hypothesis
-variables: they can come from a hypothesis stemming from common sense (i.e. proverty affects crime) or literature review 

-research question can be framed around:
1. comparing the different factors' influence on crime rates in 2 cities 
2. by looking at these 2 cities as case studies coming to conlclusions arounf which factors influence crime rates
