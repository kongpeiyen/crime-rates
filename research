“This paper brings together for the first time the accumulated research on weather and crime. It discusses the theoretical background, examines research into the influence of different weather conditions (such as high temperatures, rain, and wind) on various types of criminal behaviour, outlines problems with the current research, and suggests ways of advancing knowledge about weather and crime.”

_idea for rationale_


Many scholars have conducted research on the socio-economic influences of crime, studying how poverty, education, religion, gender, etc… have an effect on crime rates. And while this research is fascinating and crucial to the construction of a solid criminal law system, it is no longer pioneering. In recent years there has been a beginning of studies around the external environmental factors influencing crime. Scholars in this field have analyzed the connection between weather, climate change and pollution on crime rates. This innovative and groundbreaking field recognizes that human beings’ behaviours are very much influenced by their environment. However, quantitative work on the topic is still very scarce. Basing our hypothesis on extensive academic literature review, our team of researchers have chosen to compare the influence of weather and air pollution on the crime rates in London and [second city]. The aim is to show that air pollution and weather impact crime rates. 
We chose these two cities because…
The timeframe is relevant because 

Time Frame proposition: 
A year in the 2000s, not sure which but much data is available for the 21st century.
