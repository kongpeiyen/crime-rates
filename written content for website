ARIMA MODEL

-> interpreting the accuracy:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/194453/interpreting-accuracy-results-for-an-arima-model-fit

Out of all the one simplest to understand is MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error). It considers actual values fed into model and fitted values from the model and calculates absolute difference between the two as a percentage of actual value and finally calculates mean of that.
