Research question: How did burglary and sexual assault change after the outbreak of covid19 in London? 

# Context and motivation

# Choice of variables
- Sexual offences

- Burglary

- Drug offences
A recent report from the UN suggested that drug markets were likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On the one hand, the report predicted an increase in drug use. Indeed, drug use has been rising for 20 years due to the population growth. However, the pandemic made the economy suffer and therefore increased unemployment while new opportunities stayed rare (UNODC, June 2020). Studies show that disadvantaged people earning less have a higher risk to face a drug use disorder which may lead them to take part in drug trafficking activities (Shaw et al., 2007). With this reasoning we would predict the number of drug offences to rise even more than what expected from March 2020.

On the other hand, the measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 spread induced a shortage of supply of certain drugs. Indeed, drug routes by air or by sea were disrupted due to closed borders and mobility restrictions (Bergeron et al., September 2020). Therefore, some criminal groups shifted their illicit drug trafficking activity towards other emerging crime opportunities like cybercrime. Others adapted their markets to the restrictions by for example, using land routes which according to the UN report has a higher control rate. As a result, more seizures are being reported on our data sources (UNODC, June 2020). This means it may not be the drug offences number that increased but the drug enforcement activities. The later point may be a limitation of our study that we have to acknowledge as it seems difficult to control it.
 
The said-complex impact of the COVID-19 on the drug offences number makes it a major variable in our crime data which in turn justify our need to use it to analyse the pandemic impact on crime in our research.

# Hypothesis

# Suggestions of available datasets
Datasets from metropolitan police : Recorded Crime: Geographic Breakdown
This is our main source of data. It shows the level of crime per borough per crime type (so for both sexual offense and burglary, both residential and commercial). It’s monthly data.
https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary

A second source is also from the metropolitan police. It compares the data of different types of crimes (such as burglary and sexual offense) from 2019 and 2020. It looks already processed but you obtain the raw data. It might be more easy to handle as you can single out the type of offense you want to obtain. It is weekly data however I don’t think we can see it per borough.

Sexual offence rate per 1000 of people in London boroughs (but it went down……)--> data in quartile of months (3months per 3months up until june 2020)
