Research question: How did burglary and sexual assault change after the outbreak of covid19 in London? 

# Context and motivation

# Choice of variables
- Sexual offences







- Burglary
Previous studies agree about the fact that burglaries, in the absence of special circumstances such as a global pandemic, are more likely to happen in unoccupied homes (Mustaine, 1997; Tseloni et al., 2002). 

The study conducted by Ashby (2020) analyzed how different types of crime changed after the pandemic by using data from 16 different cities in the USA. When looking at burglary, the study found that in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Memphis the frequency of burglary was around half compared to what it was expected to be if covid19 never occurred. However, cities such as Austin, Louisville and Minneapolis did not experience a decrease. Moreover, out of the 11 cities that saw a decrease in burglary, in only one was the difference statistically significant. 

Another research found ambiguous results when looking at how burglaries changed after covid19 in Los Angeles (Campedelli, Aziani and Favarin, 2020). More precisely, when the authors used a univariate statistical model, the results showed an increase of 0.89% with respect to the predicted value in the absence of state’s interventions, while when they used a multivariate model, a decrease of 0.58%  was found.
Hodgkinson and Andresen (2020) looked at the effect of covid19 on residential and commercial burglary in Vancouver. This is because the likelihood of burglary is strongly related to the presence of a guardian which, during the period of lockdown, varies significantly between residential homes and stores. In fact, their research found an increase in commercial burglaries, since owners and employees were not able anymore to act as capable guardians, while residential burglary showed no obvious change. 

The inconsistency of this trend suggests that more research should be conducted around this topic. The dataset we found differentiate between residential and commercial burglaries. We will keep this distinction as we hypothesize that covid19 has a different impact on them.


- Drug offences
A recent report from the UN suggested that drug markets were likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On the one hand, the report predicted an increase in drug use. Indeed, drug use has been rising for 20 years due to the population growth. However, the pandemic made the economy suffer and therefore increased unemployment while new opportunities stayed rare (UNODC, June 2020). Studies show that disadvantaged people earning less have a higher risk to face a drug use disorder which may lead them to take part in drug trafficking activities (Shaw et al., 2007). With this reasoning we would predict the number of drug offences to rise even more than what expected from March 2020.

On the other hand, the measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 spread induced a shortage of supply of certain drugs. Indeed, drug routes by air or by sea were disrupted due to closed borders and mobility restrictions (Bergeron et al., September 2020). Therefore, some criminal groups shifted their illicit drug trafficking activity towards other emerging crime opportunities like cybercrime. Others adapted their markets to the restrictions by for example, using land routes which according to the UN report has a higher control rate. As a result, more seizures are being reported on our data sources (UNODC, June 2020). This means it may not be the drug offences number that increased but the drug enforcement activities. The later point may be a limitation of our study that we have to acknowledge as it seems difficult to control it.
 
The said-complex impact of the COVID-19 on the drug offences number makes it a major variable in our crime data which in turn justify our need to use it to analyse the pandemic impact on crime in our research.

# Hypothesis
After having done an extensive literature review, we were able to formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: we hypothesize that the number of residential burglaries decreased after the outbreak of covid19
Hypothesis 2:  we hypothesize that the number of commercial burglaries increased after the outbreak of covid19
Hypothesis 3: we hypothesize that the number of sexual assaults changed after the outbreak of covid19
Hypothesis 4: we hypothesize that the number of drug offenses changed after the outbreak of covid19


# Suggestions of available datasets
Datasets from metropolitan police : Recorded Crime: Geographic Breakdown
This is our main source of data. It shows the level of crime per borough per crime type (so for both sexual offense and burglary, both residential and commercial). It’s monthly data.
https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary

A second source is also from the metropolitan police. It compares the data of different types of crimes (such as burglary and sexual offense) from 2019 and 2020. It looks already processed but you obtain the raw data. It might be more easy to handle as you can single out the type of offense you want to obtain. It is weekly data however I don’t think we can see it per borough.

data on sexual crime in london 
https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/oct/22/prosecutions-for-crimes-against-female-victims-in-uk-dropped-amid-referral-rise-lockdown-covid Police referred more cases of violence against women and girls to the CPS across all crime types during the first three months of the pandemic, rising 5% to 64,007 from 61,179 in the previous quarter.
The number of rape cases referred increased by 15%, domestic abuse cases increased by 8% and child abuse cases rose by 9%. 
However, in the most recent quarter the volume of suspects charged (but not yet prosecuted) by the CPS across all crimes of violence against women and girls decreased by 4% from 37,403 to 35,799.CPS secretly dropped 'weak' rape cases, say rights group. 
The volume of rape cases charged by the CPS decreased from 503 in the last quarter to 487 in this quarter, a fall of 3.2%.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/12/domestic-violence-surges-seven-hundred-per-cent-uk-coronavirus 
UK’s largest domestic abuse charity, Refuge, has reported a 700% increase in calls to its helpline in a single day, while a separate helpline for perpetrators of domestic abuse seeking help to change their behaviour received 25% more calls after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown.


# Sketch methods for presenting data
We will plot our data for each different type of crime rates on a distribution to check for skewness. 
We will plot the mode, median, mean as well
Since we are lucky enough to have data for each crime rate type per each London’s borough, we want to create a choropleth map showing how each type of crime changed in different areas of London. Instead of making one map for each crime, we are planning to create only one with a scrolling menu to choose which crime you want to visualize. 
For each crime, we will make a graph with time (from 2015 to 2019) on the x-axis and the number of crimes on the y-axis to see the trend over time and to check for points that do not follow the general trend (given by the predictive model). This will also allow us to see if there is a seasonal effect
For each crime type, we will create a graph with time (from January to October 2020) on the x-axis and number of crimes occurred on the y axis. There will be a trend line showing the predicted values of crime if COVID-19 did not occur, as well as the actual values of crime happening in 2020


# Sketch methods for analyzing data
Understanding relationships between COVID-19 and crime requires some estimate of how much crime would be expected to occur in the absence of the pandemic. Therefore, we plan to use crime data from 2015 to 2019 and use it to make a predictive model how crime rates are expected to be. We will then compare the results of the prediction with the actual crime data of 2020. The decision of using a forecast model was made based on previous literature review (Ashby, 2020; Campedelli, Aziani & Favarin, 2020; Hodgkinson & Andresen, 2020; University of Leeds, 2020).
While we could make a week-to-week or year-on-year comparisons of weekly or monthly crime counts, we thought that these comparisons risk drawing false conclusions and may not be accurate because they ignore long-term trends (which affect year-on-year comparisons) and seasonal variations (which complicate week to week comparisons) (Ashby, 2020).
A plausible forecast model is the ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model, which was used by Ashby (2020) or an interrupted time series model, which has been implemented in many researches in the criminology field (Hodgkinson & Andresen, 2020). 
We will then conduct statistical tests to check whether the difference between the predictive values and the actual values of crimes is statistically significant. This will allow us to either accept or reject our hypothesis. 


# Outline what a successful project will tell you about your domain of interest
Our results could be useful for the municipality and police forces of London, policy makers, and residents. 
If these 2 hypotehses are proven to be true, perhaps while the pandemic continues evolving, more resources can be diverted from preventing burglaries to sexual assault instead. 
More effort can also be spent on raising awareness of sexual assualt within the local London community.
This allows one to be aware of this issue and thereby be able to look out for potential signs of sexual assault that others may display.
