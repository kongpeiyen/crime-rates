27 Oct Tues meeting - homework for 30.10

- monthly data on air pollution and weather in Hong kong and London 
- more monthly data on crime 
- do workshop before Fri 
- ask PGTA what they think of our data

-find statistics fir rain days in HK 
-update website
-update biographies 
-read each others relevant research  

30 Oct Friday meeting - homework for 02.11
- Start working on project proposal (file created on GitHub)
- Update biographies
- During meeting: try to figure out what data visualisation we want to do

TO DO ON GOOGLE DRIVE 4 5.11 at 11 am
-highlight what is important in each other's parts to reduce word count  

(Camilla reduce Jana & Pei parts // Jana reduced Pei & Camilla) 

-add Tiphaine’s comments to Alaric’s part  

-Alaric’s part needs to be more developed and more precise, it is too general right now and the methods is the most important part  

->add more stuff from Monday meeting  

-> more stuff based on the lecture content from week 5 

-> mapping  

-> bar charts explanation needs to be clearer  

-make comments on each other's parts  

Meeting at 11 am tomorrow - have this done by meeting tomorrow because we will need to read the new version


11-11-2020 meeting at 1pm 

-graph: ozone levels according to time (J + T)
-graph: temperature according to time (P + C)
-graph: different crime rates according to time (A)
These graphs should be done using Python on google collab

-video: write an outline of structure (J)

aim for tomorrow: plan the video and start the correlation 


27-11-20 workshop at 2pm 

aim: start working on the data visualizations 
-research folium map code: tiphaine 
-research predictive module code: Camilla 
-summary statistics code: Jana and Pei 
-regressions: Alaric 

meeting 30.11.2020 at 9am

-continue working on predictive models and research the auto Python function for ARIMA models (steps 2-4) - Camilla
-continue working on folium map code - Tiphaine 
-find a way of making the data exploitable (not have it divided by borough) -Alaric, Jana and Pei 

meeting 07.12.2020 at 9am
-test the predictive model with datra from excel: Camilla 
-find how to make timescale: Tiphaine
-work on cleaning data: Alaric 
-test the code for summary statstics: Pei
-work on website and add content: Jana 


#meeting 10.12.2020 at 11am:
-continue research for code that will no longerb use Python as a varible: Alaric 
-> follow help leads 
-work on incorporating timeslider to chloroplet code: Tiphaine
-test the predictive model code with cleaned data (excel file while we wait to find Python code): Camilla 
-work on the organisation of website and the design: Jana 
-> meeting goals: prepare questions for office hours, discuss cleaning of data with Python code and goals to reach before holidays 
-> workshop: continue these taks 

#meeting 14.12.20 at 9am:
-work on using pandas filter sum to clean code: Alaric + Jana 
-find a new way of doing the map which works with our data set: Tiphaine and Pei
-find a way of testing predictive model: Camilla 

There have been major set back this week in the sense that the way we thjought we could clean our data did not work but our goal is still to finish the codes by the holidays 

#for office hours 17.12.20

-work on testing the accuracy of the predicted model: Camilla and Jana 
-work on new clhoropleth map: Tiphiane and Pei 
-continue work on cleaning data: Alaric and Jana 

#workshop 18.12.20

-continue work on Chloroplet map: Tiphaine and Pei
-work on advice Daniel gave for data cleanng issues: Alaric and Jana 
-try solving problem with the arrays in predictive model: Camilla and Jana 

notes from workshop 18.12.20: 
-read the Shby 2020 paper, sction on how model is tested again
-try using MAE to test the accuracy of the model 
-use conf_int[1] to extract te array 
-find a way to permanently keep the datasets in the code to avoid contsantly uploading them 
WEBSITE:
-explain the meaning of the data visualisations
-do not import any graphs without an explanation
-do not ave too many pages in the website and do not have any unlinked pages
-have a narrative on the cleaning of the data 
-write for a lay audience 

next meeting: Saturday 19.12.20

#meeting 19.12.20 14:30 UK
-need to work on selecting sections of the dataset to run the model
-need to test the predictive model with the cleaned data
-find another data visualisation for simpy presenting our cleaned data 
-work on the structure of the website and building of the narrative
-set working deadlines for the holidays

#tasks for meeting Tuesday 22.12.20 at 10am UK 
-work on the structure of the wesite (there are too many pages and unlinked ones): Pei and Jana
-work on content for the website (what we can write about so far): Jana 
-work on importing the cleaned data into predictive model and test te model: Camilla and Tiphaine
-find the last data visulisation: Alaric

to discuss in meeting: 
-how the model works 
-last data visualiation
possibly creting new website as te structure is very unclear? but issue of showing the credit for the past work done on initial websiste...
