# Guidelines and roles

This proposal should:
•  provide context and motivation (Jana and Pei)

• suggest available datasets and/or sources of data (Tiphaine, to check which is most suitable + how it can help w the data presentation)
For London, we mostly found datasets on the crime rate from the metropolitan police database. However, for the weather attributes we were thinking of using different sources. Both of the datasets we obtained were created by London universities (King's College London and Imperial College London) and shared through the datastore website (therefore supported by the  GLA). 
Most of these datasets are in the csv format and mesure our variables monthly which will allow us to get a better precision.
For Hong Kong, we struggled more to find open data on the crime rate. The sources available are the open data from the Hong Kong police force and global organizations such as the United Nations.  For the weather attributes, we also found two useful national sources which are open data from the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong observatory.
These datasets abtained are in the csv and xls formats. They mesure our variables ona monthly and anually basis which mean that we might have to pair our data according to the time frame used to measure the variables.

• sketch methods for analysing and presenting data (Alaric) 

• outline what a successful project will tell you about your domain of interest (Camilla)
Answering our research question through visualizations and statistical analysis will allow us to find out whether the effect of air pollution and weather on crime rates is statistically significant. 
While we might be careful in generalizing our findings to other cities, our results could surely be useful for several people, such as the municipality and police force of London and Hong Kong, and people considering moving to one of these cities. 
Moreover, since not much research has been conducted on this topic yet, we are confident that our findings will bring some clarity about the ambiguous relationship between weather and air pollution on crime rates and that they can be off inspiration for future research.
