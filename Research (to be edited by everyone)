# VARIABLES
Previous studies discovered that air pollution caused a psychological effect on people which would make them act more unethically. One example is that experience of aire pollution increases anxiety which then make them more prone to act unethically.(Lu et al. 2018. Polluted morality: Air pollution predicts criminal activity and unethical behavior.)
(Burkhardt et al. 2019. The effect of pollution on crime: Evidence from data on particulate matter and ozone.)--> Second study which investigate how air pollution might influence agressive behavior and therefore assault. They talk about how O3 and PM can induce systemic inflammation which would then increase cognitive and motor symptoms. This process can also lead to agressive behavior.
Both of these research mainly focused on the concentrations of the 1st two variables of the list below.
Air pollution:
- Fine particulate matter (PM 2,5) concentrations and precipitations
- Emissions of O3, SO2, NO2, BaP (which are the most polluting chemicals)
- Emissions of CO2 (Most of greenhouse gases emissions BUT less impact than the others)--> Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies. 2020. Air Pollution And Climate change.

Weather: 
Previous research found that temperature and precipitation have a significant effect on the number of violent crimes recorded and that
temperature also affects the number of property crimes recorded (Horrocks, & Menclova, 2011 - "The effects of weather on crime)
Another study (Cohn, 1990, "Weather and crime") analyzes:
- temperature
- sunlight (lenght of the day)
- wind
- precipitation  
- humidity

Other factors to consider: 

- atmospheric pressure (only some studies find a relationship, the majority does not)

Crime:
Study conducted by Cohn (1990) analyzes the relationship between heat (temperature) and 
- collective violence (riots), 
- assault,
- homicide
- robbery (ambigous relationship with weather)
- domestic violence

“This paper brings together for the first time the accumulated research on weather and crime. It discusses the theoretical background, examines research into the influence of different weather conditions (such as high temperatures, rain, and wind) on various types of criminal behaviour, outlines problems with the current research, and suggests ways of advancing knowledge about weather and crime.”


RESEARCH FOR LITERATURE REVIEW

WEATHER AND CRIME
https://www.jstor.org/stable/23638231?seq=1
Cohn, E. (1990). WEATHER AND CRIME. The British Journal of Criminology, 30(1), 51-64. Retrieved November 4, 2020, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/23638231
- There is a recent theoretical basis for research into the influence of weather on crime: the situational approach, rational choice theory, and routine activities theory all suggest that weather could significantly influence crime rates and criminal behaviour. This paper brings together for the first time the accumulated research on weather and crime.
-looks at heat and crime, sunshine and crime, rain and crime....
-rain and crime: no conclusive research on the effect of rain on crime rates, but because inconclusive research has been conducted it is interesting to further investigate the question 
-> De Fronzo (1984) and Perry and Simpson (1987)
-obvious link between rain and robbery in the sense that if it is pouring people aren’t going to go out but it is interesting to look at different categories of crime for example no found correlation between homicide and rain and rape and rain 
-important to consider the factors that show that correlation does not imply causation:
*alcohol consumption increases with heat and alcohol consumption increases crime rates 
*social interactions increase with heat and research has found that most vrimes happen between friends and family members

Ranson, M. (2012). CRIME, WEATHER, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. Harvard Kennedy School
The results show that temperature has a strong positive effect on criminal behavior, with little evidence of lagged impacts.


https://www.zmescience.com/science/weather-crime-connection-04234/#:~:text=WARM%20WEATHER%20LEADS%20TO%20HIGHER%20CRIME%20RATES,-Tracking%20ambient%20temperature&text=Researchers%20found%20that%20temperature%20changes,centigrade%20rise%20in%20the%20temperature
Fortunately, multiple studies have been completed to determine whether there is any truth to the claims that weather conditions in either extreme contribute to an increased likelihood of criminal activity. These studies have provided important insights into the ways that temperature influence the frequency of certain crimes.
Another major American city, Chicago, provides further insights into the impact of weather and temperature on crime rates. Police crime data from the City of Chicago Data Portal indicates that within the annual summer crime peak, certain types of crime appear more weather-dependent. Out of seven major crime categories, theft, along with shootings and other battery, saw the greatest increase as temperatures rose, with nine additional incidents for every 10-degree temperature increase.
Knowing that hot weather is a factor in crime rates is valuable for law enforcement, and even more important is understanding why temperature seems to have such an influence on violence.
Two main theories have been presented as the key reasons that hot temperatures may encourage additional criminal activity: the increase in opportunities for crime and the changes in temperament that result from warmer weather.

OPPORTUNITY AND CRIME: WARM WEATHER

Along with increased opportunities for property-related crimes, there is an increase in interactions between people. Statistically speaking, more interactions provide a higher likelihood of a violent or criminal encounter.

TEMPERATURE AND HUMAN TEMPERAMENT 
In the Finland study, hot temperatures were linked to changes in brain chemistry that made impulse and aggressive actions more likely — and it is far from the only research to make this connection.
For environmentalists, the correlation between hot weather and crime is a valuable aspect of understanding the full impact of environmental changes on individuals. With the threat of global warming, temperature’s effect on crime rates becomes an even greater concern, and yet another reason to pay better attention to the environment.

AIR POLLUTION AND CRIME RATES:

- According to the discussion paper, published by the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), higher levels of air pollution increases the rate of most types of crime in the capital and, in particular, less severe kinds such as shop lifting and pickpocketing.
However, air pollution was not found to have a significant impact on the most serious crimes such as murder, assault causing severe bodily harm or rape.
Dr Sefi Roth, Assistant Professor of Environmental Economics and co-author of the paper, said: “Our research suggests that reducing air pollution in urban areas could be a cost effective way to reduce crime, in addition to the health benefits it would bring.
“We did not find that London’s ongoing spate of knife crime would be affected by improved air quality. However, if the number of less serious crimes could be reduced, the police could potentially be freed up to allocate more resources to these types of very serious incidents.
“The effect of air pollution on crime occurs at levels which are well below current regulatory standards in the UK and the US which suggests that it could be beneficial to lower these existing guidelines.”

The researchers suggest the link they found between air pollution and crime may be linked to the increases in the stress hormone cortisol that can occur in people exposed to higher levels of pollution.
http://ftp.iza.org/dp11492.pdf _ lse research paper
. We formally explore the underlying mechanism for our finding and conclude that the effect of air pollution on crime is likely mediated by higher discounting of future punishment.
Overall, our results suggest that reducing air pollution in urban areas may be a cost effective measure to reduce crime.

Experimental evidence documents that, if anything, subjects become more risk averse when administered the stress hormone cortisol (Kandasamy et al., 2014) or when exposed to physical stress (Porcelli and Delgado, 2009). As we discuss further below, acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to elevated levels of cortisol (Li et al., 2017). We would consequently expect to result in individuals becoming more risk averse when exposed to higher levels of pollution. In sum, both existing empirical evidence and our rudimentary analysis using lottery sales suggest that if anything air pollution may reduce risk taking behaviour and thus is unlikely to explain the observed increase in criminal activity on polluted days.

Air pollution increases crime in cities – here’s how

Whilst the researchers found a positive effect of increased air pollution on violent crimes, and specifically assaults, they found no relationship between increases in air pollution and property crimes.
Earlier this year, AirQualityNews published a Conversation article from Gary Haq from the University of York about air pollution and crime.
He wrote that exposure to poor quality air can increase the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead people to take more risks and commit crimes on polluted days.

The impact of air pollution on human health is well-documented, but research suggests it might increase bad behaviour and lead to criminality, writes Gary Haq of the University of York.
https://theconversation.com/air-pollution-increases-crime-in-cities-heres-how-95975
Short-term exposure to air pollution, especially sulphur dioxide, has been associated with a high risk of hospital admissions for mental disorders in Shanghai. And in Los Angeles, a study concluded that higher levels of particulate matter pollution increases teenage delinquent behaviour in urban neighbourhoods – though of course these effects are compounded by poor relationships between parents and children, as well as social and mental distress on the part of the parents.
It now believed that exposure to air pollutants can cause inflammation in the brain. What’s more, fine particulate matter is harmful to developing brains, because it can damage brain and neural networks and influence behaviour.
he link between high levels of air pollution and increases in type of behaviour requires further robust evidence to determine a stronger causal link.
But there’s plenty of evidence to prove that poor air quality is bad for both our physical and mental health.
