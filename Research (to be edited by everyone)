“This paper brings together for the first time the accumulated research on weather and crime. It discusses the theoretical background, examines research into the influence of different weather conditions (such as high temperatures, rain, and wind) on various types of criminal behaviour, outlines problems with the current research, and suggests ways of advancing knowledge about weather and crime.”


Time Frame proposition: 
A year in the 2000s, not sure which but much data is available for the 21st century. 
recent data is , significant because it shows the relevance to today.
