CHOROPLETH MAP

-explain how the map works
We decided to create a dual Choropleth map using a folium library which allowed to illustrate and compare the evolution of our selected crimes and COVID-19 spread. In other words, we depicted the amount of each crime type (Burglary, Drug offences and Sexual offences) across the different London boroughs in 2020 compared to the amount of covid cases in each borough during the same time period. 

-analysis of map's results
The map translates our data into a geospatial visualisationthe geographic evolution of the data and our previous conclusions

-explain motivations and what the map brings to the project 
Our aim with this cartogram was to take a closer on the impact of COVID on crime. We wanted to add a more specific geospatial notion to our analysis. The model already provided on the impact of COVID-19 on London's crime rate. However, it focused on London as a whole rather than each of its boroughs. The map added this more particular analysis angle. 

We also wanted to see if the differences in the number of COVID-19 between the boroughs could be somehow linked to their crime rate differences. The possible relationship between crime and COVID could then be induced not only by the city's multiple lockdowns but also by the individual's own health psychology. Therefore creating a map would allow a more complex and thorough analysis for our project.

Furthermore, The repoducibility of our project was of great importance for us as our theme is still on going and recent.Therefore, creating a dual map on which you can add choroplethlayers on top of one another represents also a dynamic, interactive and accessible method to understand our project.

-code gists
Below is a part of our code to create a folium dual map with a choropleth layer. The full version can be found here.

# Creating the dual map object
m = folium.plugins.DualMap(location=[51.5074, 0.1278], zoom_start=10)

# Adding the choropleth layer onto the map
folium.Choropleth(
    geo_data=boroughsdata,
    name='COVID-19 infections',
    data=normalized_covid_with_borough,
    columns=['area_name', 'Normalized Total'],
    key_on='properties.name',
    fill_color='Blues',
    fill_opacity=0.7,
    line_opacity=0.5,
    bins=6,
    nan_fill_color='White',
    nan_fill_opacity=0.8,
    legend_name='Covid infections',
    overlay=True,
    show=True
).add_to(m.m1)

-limitations
Although it provides us with a great overview of crime and COVID-19 spread, the map admits some limitations. 
First and foremost, the visualisation is not the most efficient for a comparison. The markers we chose (colored layers) cannot be put on top of one another. Each category has its color code therefore you cannot visualize all four of our variables at the same time. In other words, you can only put one layer at a time on each map which restricts our analysis.

Moreover the data we mapped represents London boroughs in 2020 up until November. The scope is therefore short sighted and the conclusions drawn must be interpreted accordingly. We took it into account when analysing our results and encourage any future project to reproduce it to challenge our results.
