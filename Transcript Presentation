# Context






Lastly, we feel that understanding which crimes have increased during covid19 is essential to raising awareness and providing support for survivors and potential victims. 
This has been made obvious by the rise in domestic abuse during the first lockdown and more people turning to drugs. 
We also hope that shedding light on the effect that lockdowns have on certain people who become victims of crime will help enlarge societal sensibility.
This will further urge people to respect government imposed lockdowns to prevent the number of victims susceptible to crimes from increasing. 


# Choice of variables
## COVID-19 and burglary
Our first variable we are examining is burglary. burglary can occur in the residential or commercial sphere. 
Previous studies done on the effect of COVID19 on burglary. However, there have been many different results that have been reported. 
For example, a study conducted by Ashby found that some states in the US experienced an increase in burglary while others did not. It varied greatly amongst the different states. 
Another study done by Hodgkinson and Andresen looked at the effect of covid19 on residential and commercial burglary in Vancouver. They found an increase in commercial burglaries.
As seen, there is an ambiguous effect of covid19 on burglary, and the group wants to examine this specifically in the context of London. 
The literature we have read guides our research hypothesis, which is that the number of commercial burglaries increased after the outbreak of COVID-19





## COVID-19 and sexual offences
There are  different offences that qualify as sexual offences in England and Wales which are defined in the 2003 Sexual Offence Act. However, following our available data we are going to look at sexual offences as a whole.

Why choose sexual assault as a variable?
Comes from an important amount of news coverage and social awareness campaigns on the rise of domestic abuse during lockdown. 
However, instead of looking at only domestic abuse we thought it more interesting to add the analysis of sexual offences during this period of time . 
Furthermore, our choice of variable also has a feminist motivation. We wanted to use our analysis to explore the effect the pandemic has had on women as sexual offences are categorized as VAWG crimes.

## COVID-19 and drug offences
If we look at drug offences we can see 2 conflicting trends.

On the one hand, the pandemic made the economy suffer which increased unemployment which in turn increased drug use disorders according to previous studies. 

On the other hand, in the UK drug offences have been decreasing for the past 5 years.  Furthermore, a BBC article described a general decrease for drug crimes in the UK as the only augmentations were seen in small towns. 
This is why we believe it is worth analyzing this variable further. 

# Data sources

# Data analysis
Firstly, we will perform some descriptive statistics. We will plot our data for each different type of crime rate to see if it is normally distributed  and to check for skewness. We will plot the mode, median, mean as well.

Secondly, to understand the relationships between COVID-19 and crime, we need some estimates of how much crime would be expected to occur in the absence of the pandemic. Therefore, we plan to use crime data from 2015 to 2019 and use it to make a predictive model how crime rates are expected to be. We will then compare the results of the prediction with the actual crime data of 2020. 
Finally, we will then conduct statistical tests to check whether the difference between the predictive values and the actual values of crimes is statistically significant. This will allow us to either accept or reject our hypothesis.


# Data visualization

# Limitations
Our group has used predictive methods in the project. we acknowledge that predictive methods are not totally accurate and the data we have predicted is not set in stone. 
As the majority of our data was retrieved from the Metropolitan Police Service, we are limited to the impact that covid19 has on reported crimes only. However, literature suggests that the amount of unreported sexual offences has increased because the ability of survivors to report crimes is limited by national lockdowns. 
We acknowledge that this study is necessarily limited and it will be possible to understand more as the pandemic progresses and more data become available. however, we will use the most up to date data that can be found for this project. 
additionally, we also are aware that there are other factors which affect crime rates as well, such as weather, and these changes in crime may not necessarily be solely because of covid19. 



# Website
Here is a peek of our website. we have divided the sections into context, variables and data. under the context section, we talked about the context and motivation, and the importance of our research. 
under variables,  we talk about why london, why this timeframe, and why these crimes 
under data, we talk about our data sources, the methods of analysing data, present our data visualisation and analysis, and acknowledge our potential limitations  
Thank you !




# Question preparation 
1. context and motivation

2. Limitations 
Why are survivors less able to report crimes during lockdowns? 
This is due to the fact that survivors may be living with the perpetrator and fear them finding out about the allegations they must make from their own home as lockdowns restrict movements. 
Moreover, survivors of sexual offences may be less willing to seek assistance from fear of contracting the virus.
The pandemic also has the negative consequence of deprioritizing all administrative processes and services needed by survivors (news.un.org, https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/06/1066712). 
however, the group does not have access to other non-reported statistics, and have done the best we could to find and retrieve open-source data for this project. 
we will do our statistical analysis based on the best possible data that we can retrieve. 

3. Why this timeframe ?
The timeframe we are using is from 2015 to 2020. 
This is because although COVID only began this year, there was still data on crime for the years before COVID began (prior to 2019). 
We hence felt that using this data we felt that we could still make use of such data to analyse how crime trends were like before COVID.
From this, we can make a comparison with the rich evidence we had with the crime rate data after COVID began. 
While we could make a week-to-week or year-on-year comparisons of weekly or monthly crime counts, we thought that these comparisons risk drawing false conclusions and may not be accurate because they ignore long-term trends (which affect year-on-year comparisons) and seasonal variations (which complicate week to week comparisons) (Ashby, 2020). 
Hence, we will be doing an analysis on the monthly data. This hence takes into account the seasonal patterns of crime and would make for a more accurate comparison of the crime statistics. 



4. Why london?
We chose London because London has the 3rd highest crime rate in the UK, with 94.9 crimes per 1000 people. 
Therefore, we expect that there will be enough data and statistics available to support our analysis. 
Additionally, London has the largest population in the UK. 
hence we felt like the findings from this project would impact and benefit a huge number of individuals
Lastly, to our knowledge, based on the extensive research that the group has done before deciding on this topic, there has been no other study that has covered the effect of covid on these specific crimes in London. 
Thus, we would like to plug that gap in research through this project.
