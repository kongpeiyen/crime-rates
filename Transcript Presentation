# Context

# Choice of variables
## COVID-19 and burglary
## COVID-19 and sexual offences
There are  different offences that qualify as sexual offences in England and Wales which are defined in the 2003 Sexual Offence Act. However, following our available data we are going to look at sexual offences as a whole.

Why choose sexual assault as a variable?
Comes from an important amount of news coverage and social awareness campaigns on the rise of domestic abuse during lockdown. 
However, instead of looking at only domestic abuse we thought it more interesting to add the analysis of sexual offences during this period of time . 
Furthermore, our choice of variable also has a feminist motivation. We wanted to use our analysis to explore the effect the pandemic has had on women as sexual offences are categorized as VAWG crimes.

## COVID-19 and drug offences
If we look at drug offences we can see 2 conflicting trends.

On the one hand, the pandemic made the economy suffer which increased unemployment which in turn increased drug use disorders according to previous studies. 

On the other hand, in the UK drug offences have been decreasing for the past 5 years.  Furthermore, a BBC article described a general decrease for drug crimes in the UK as the only augmentations were seen in small towns. 
This is why we believe it is worth analyzing this variable further. 

# Data sources

# Data analysis
Firstly, we will perform some descriptive statistics. We will plot our data for each different type of crime rate to see if it is normally distributed  and to check for skewness. We will plot the mode, median, mean as well.

Secondly, to understand the relationships between COVID-19 and crime, we need some estimates of how much crime would be expected to occur in the absence of the pandemic. Therefore, we plan to use crime data from 2015 to 2019 and use it to make a predictive model how crime rates are expected to be. We will then compare the results of the prediction with the actual crime data of 2020. 
Finally, we will then conduct statistical tests to check whether the difference between the predictive values and the actual values of crimes is statistically significant. This will allow us to either accept or reject our hypothesis.
